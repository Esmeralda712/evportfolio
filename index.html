          <div class="about">
          <p> As someone who always had a knack for the artistic world, Esmeralda Villalpando takes inspiration from the world around her and implements her creativity in all facets of her life. Most recently it was through creating digital content for the company Amore Creative, which specializes in custom designs for wedding stationery and small business branding.</p>

          <p>During her time studying at Columbia College Chicago, she has taken many courses that provided exposure to insightful projects and experiences. Esmeralda has become equipped with valuable experience in the marketing industry through working as a marketing strategist and consultant for Dermacol, a Czech beauty brand. Contributing to the research, development, and strategy implementation in Dermacol’s 2022-2023 marketing plan/report toward their launch in the U.S. market. This was an eye-opening experience that allowed Esmeralda to be immersed in the inner workings of a successful product launch.</p>

          <p>Additionally, she has developed sufficient web development skills (the entirely of this portfolio showcases those skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and has made her journey of learning data Analytics much smoother. When it comes to design skills, she gives credit to her years of creative aspirations. The many years of painting and drawing eventually turned into graphic design capabilities. Esmeralda is always looking for the best and unique ways to look at situations and is continuously open to building new relationships</p>
